Today I'm doing research on how to optimize the experience in SH Disneyland park. After browsing the journals posted on mafengwo.com, I'm actually confused of the best ways to  accomplish it (actually optimization is not defined). During the night I'm working on a book & vedios about AI and am pondering the ways to properly solve the problem.

Why is it always hard to make a trip plan? There are too many unexpected factors, the mismatch of reality and expectations, lack of/ out-dated infomation... In that sense, for a disneyland resort of today, the infomation is fairly sufficient for making decisions so it should be easier.

If it is not the first FP, according to the game played and expectation of unplayed games, decide which to get next.
